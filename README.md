# Learn React in about 4 Videos!

This is the code that accompanies the video series. You can find there video series here:

[Learn React in about 4 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVQhCFMvcEGlxIBLzEsqvAT0D_QoMflE)

Each directory in the repo corresponds to the app *at the end* of one of the videos. So `kanban1` is the app at the end of video 1, etc.

## What you need to play along at home

You will need npm, node and npx (npx comes with recent versions of npm).

[Installing node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

You will also need a code editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but anything will work, including notepad.

Finally, in the video I use `yarn` to run commands. Yarn is a package manager and does about the same job as npm. You have two options here. 

a) [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) 

pros: you can follow the video along exactly, no need to adjust any of the instructions
cons: one more thing to install

**or**

b) use npm instead. This is pretty simple. Any time I run a command like this `yarn [command]`, you substitute it with `npm run [command]`

pros: you're done here
cons: you have to make these running adjustments to the instructions as you go along
